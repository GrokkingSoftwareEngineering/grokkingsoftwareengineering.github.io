# API Design Fundamentals

Principles for designing clear, consistent, and scalable APIs.

## Prerequisites
- Programming basics
- Comfort with core data structures and algorithms

## What You'll Learn
- Resource modeling and naming conventions
- Versioning and backward compatibility
- Error handling and consistency

## Why It Matters
- APIs are long-lived contracts with clients
- Consistency reduces onboarding time and bugs
- Good design improves scalability and change management

## Core Concepts
### Resource Modeling
- Entities, collections, and sub-resources
- Uniform naming and paths

### Request and Response Design
- Status codes and error formats
- Pagination and filtering

### Versioning Strategies
- URI vs header-based versioning
- Backward compatibility policies

### Consistency and Observability
- Standard error envelopes
- Correlation IDs and logs

### Documentation and Governance
- API documentation and change management
- Deprecation strategy

## Worked Examples (Node.js-Style Pseudocode)
- Placeholder for end-to-end examples in JavaScript-like pseudocode
- Focus on clarity of concepts over language-specific features

## Common Pitfalls
- Breaking changes without versioning
- Inconsistent error handling across endpoints
- Skipping pagination on large lists

## Best Practices
- Design with consumers in mind
- Document decisions and example payloads
- Use semantic versioning for API changes

## Try It Yourself
1. Design a CRUD API for a real product
2. Define a consistent error model
3. Create a versioning plan for breaking changes

## Next Steps
- Add case studies and real-world tradeoffs
- Link concepts to adjacent topics in the roadmap
