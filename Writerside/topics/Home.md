# Engineering Foundations

Welcome to **Engineering Foundations** — a long-form, anti-brain-rot learning path for serious software engineering study. The goal is depth, clarity, and durable understanding rather than quick tips.

## Mission

Short-form content optimizes for attention, not comprehension. This project exists to rebuild the fundamentals with thorough explanations, real context, and a structured path from basics to advanced topics.

## Who This Is For

- Students building a solid CS foundation
- Junior engineers leveling up beyond syntax
- Mid-level engineers aiming for system-level thinking
- Experienced engineers revisiting fundamentals
- Career changers who need structure and depth

## Current Structure

Right now, the site focuses on a **Computer Science** roadmap. Topics are organized into the following major sections:

- Data Structures
- Asymptotic Notation
- Common Algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion, trees, graphs, greedy, backtracking, caches)
- Endianness and Floating Point Math
- String Search & Manipulations
- Character Encodings and Bitwise Operators
- Common UML Diagrams and Design Patterns
- Basic Math Skills and Complexity Classes
- Databases
- System Design
- Balanced Search Trees
- Networking
- Security
- How Computers Work
- Processes and Threads

Each box in the roadmap is a dedicated article, and the TOC mirrors the roadmap structure.

## Roadmap Source

The structure is adapted from the **roadmap.sh Computer Science roadmap** and expanded into long-form articles. Credit to roadmap.sh for the underlying layout and sequencing.

## Dedicated Roadmaps

We also maintain deep, dedicated roadmaps for:

- [Data Structures & Algorithms Roadmap](dsa-roadmap.md)
- [System Design Roadmap](system-design-roadmap.md)

## How to Use This Resource

1. Start with the broad sections and drill down into subtopics.
2. Follow the TOC order to build concepts progressively.
3. Practice actively with the examples and exercises.

## Language-Agnostic by Design

Examples use **Node.js-style JavaScript** and **pseudocode** for consistency, but the concepts are language-agnostic.
