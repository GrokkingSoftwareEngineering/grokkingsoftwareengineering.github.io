# UML Diagrams

Visual modeling tools for communicating structure and behavior.

## Prerequisites
- Programming basics
- Comfort with core data structures and algorithms

## What You'll Learn
- Class, sequence, and activity diagrams
- How to capture state and use cases
- What UML is good for (and what it is not)

## Why It Matters
- Diagrams speed up collaboration and reviews
- UML provides a shared vocabulary for design
- Visual models reveal hidden assumptions

## Core Concepts
### Class Diagrams
- Relationships, composition, and inheritance
- Modeling domain entities and aggregates

### Sequence Diagrams
- Message flow and time ordering
- Capturing synchronous and asynchronous calls

### Activity Diagrams
- Control flow and branching
- Modeling business processes

### State Machine Diagrams
- State transitions and events
- Modeling lifecycle-driven systems

### Use Case Diagrams
- Actors and system boundaries
- Capturing user goals

## Worked Examples (Node.js-Style Pseudocode)
- Placeholder for end-to-end examples in JavaScript-like pseudocode
- Focus on clarity of concepts over language-specific features

## Common Pitfalls
- Over-documenting and letting diagrams go stale
- Using UML for trivial relationships
- Assuming diagrams replace executable specs

## Best Practices
- Keep diagrams focused on communication value
- Update diagrams during major changes
- Pair diagrams with written decisions

## Try It Yourself
1. Create a sequence diagram for a checkout flow
2. Model a state machine for an order lifecycle
3. Draft a class diagram for a domain model

## Next Steps
- Add case studies and real-world tradeoffs
- Link concepts to adjacent topics in the roadmap
