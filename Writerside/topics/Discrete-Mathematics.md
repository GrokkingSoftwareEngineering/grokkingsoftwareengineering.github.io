# Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science

Core discrete math concepts that underpin algorithms, data structures, and complexity analysis.

## Prerequisites
- Programming basics
- Comfort with core data structures and algorithms

## What You'll Learn
- Counting, probability, and combinatorics for algorithm analysis
- Sets, relations, and graphs for modeling problems
- Proof techniques for rigorous reasoning

## Why It Matters
- Improves ability to analyze correctness and complexity
- Makes algorithm design more systematic
- Builds foundations for complexity theory and graphs

## Core Concepts
### Counting and Combinatorics
- Permutations, combinations, and the pigeonhole principle
- Asymptotic growth intuition from counting

### Probability Foundations
- Events, conditional probability, and expectation
- Modeling randomized algorithms

### Sets, Relations, and Functions
- Equivalence relations and partial orders
- Function properties and mappings

### Graphs as Mathematical Models
- Graph terminology and properties
- Connectivity and bipartite reasoning

### Proof Strategies
- Direct, contradiction, and induction proofs
- Invariants and loop correctness reasoning

## Worked Examples (Node.js-Style Pseudocode)
- Placeholder for end-to-end examples in JavaScript-like pseudocode
- Focus on clarity of concepts over language-specific features

## Common Pitfalls
- Treating probability intuition as proof
- Using the wrong model for counting problems
- Skipping proof steps that hide incorrect assumptions

## Best Practices
- Write simple proofs before coding algorithms
- Validate assumptions with small counterexamples
- Use diagrams to model relationships before formalizing

## Try It Yourself
1. Prove correctness for a simple greedy algorithm
2. Model a real system as a graph and analyze connectivity
3. Compute expectation for a randomized algorithm

## Next Steps
- Add case studies and real-world tradeoffs
- Link concepts to adjacent topics in the roadmap
