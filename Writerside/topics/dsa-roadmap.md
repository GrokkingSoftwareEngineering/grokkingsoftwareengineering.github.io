# Data Structures & Algorithms

This section is a dedicated, long-form expansion of the **roadmap.sh Data Structures & Algorithms roadmap**. Every box in the roadmap becomes a full article with context, trade-offs, and practical examples.

If you want the broader Computer Science path, start at [Computer Science](Computer-Science.md) and follow the TOC.

_TODO: Add content. Examples will use Node.js and pseudocode._
